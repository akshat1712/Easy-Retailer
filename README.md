Project to make Retailed Business working easier

# Idea
Our project helps to solve the issues of customers in small cities where a lot of shopping is done via local markets. Many a times, we go to store to find that item is not there in the shop. So, in this project, we provide an interface where retailers and consumers can update & check availability of items in shops. Customers can query for an item with location to get shops where you will find the item given. Retailers can update their inventory to show its effects on queries of customers. We also show popular retailer & popular items which can help future planning of retailers & consumer easier.


# Features
* Reatailers can register and login to manage their inventories and see popular items for insight.
* Customers can search for commodities to get names and contacts of retailers with available items.
